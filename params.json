  "body": "# RAuth - Reliable Robust Radix Authentication\r\n> RAuth token based authentication system build on top of Java and Redis.\r\n\r\nThe general concept behind a RAuth token-based authentication system is simple. Allow users to enter their username and password in order to obtain a token which allows them to fetch a specific resource - without using their username and password. Once their token has been obtained, the user can offer the token - which offers access to a specific resource for a time period - to the remote site.\r\n\r\nRAuth is a java library which provides token-based authentication system for all type of java projects or can run independently to support your existing system.\r\n\r\n# Quick Installation\r\n\r\n* Add RAuth jar into your project.\r\n* RAuth requires a separate directory containing `app.properties` file. For linux and unix operating systems it should be `/opt/rauth/` and for windows it should be `C:\\rauth`.\r\n* RAuth provides a facility to create independent database connection pools as well. If you want to use your connection pooling mechanism you need to pass it to DataHelper class.\r\n* To authenticate a user simply call static method, `RAuth.authUser(\"USERNAME\", \"PASSWORD\");`. This method will return `User` object.\r\n```\r\nUser u = RAuth.authUser(\"username\", \"password\");\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nif(u.getUserStatus().equals(UserStatus.ACTIVATE)) {\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\tString jwt = RAuth.issueJwt(Audience, Payload);\t\t\t\r\n}\r\n```\r\n* Store this token in your client and send it with your request to the server.\r\n* The method `RAuth.authJwt(Audience, jwt)` returns payload from the token. Extract and verify token from its payload.\r\nThat's it. Isn't it really simple?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
